# Source-Sync
Source Sync is a web app for anime lovers. It uses AI to perform a deep, contextual analysis comparing an anime adaptation to its original source material. The application goes beyond simple text matching to identify and explain the narrative significance of scenes, character moments, and entire "mini-arcs" that were cut or altered in the anime.
